# PorjectCleaningData

 You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
 
 
 This repo contains four files:
 
 1) run_analysis.R* - This is the script that cleans the datasets and outputs both the tidy_dataset.txt and means.txt files. The stipulation is that the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder be in the directory containing run_analysis.R.
 
 2) means.txt - This is the dataset that contains the means of the mean and standard deviation variables amongst each subject performing each activity.
 
 3) tidy_dataset.txt - This dataset contains the full tidy dataset of each subject performing each activity and the measured variables associated with them.
 
 4) CodeBook.md - This code book describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
 
 *This analysis was done assuming that we needed to stack the train and test datasets and the activities are either Train [activity] or Test [activity] and variable means were taken this way.
